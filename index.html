        <h1>Hi my name is Adam, <span>I am a UX designer based in Dublin</span></h1>
        <p>
          I am a business professional with wide experience in mentoring and people management on one side, and on the other determined bike-packer and volunteer in NGOs around the world with a focus on improving life of others. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to this perfect mix of business understanding and user-centred approach to solving problems, I have decided to pursue a career of UX Designer and never looked back.

            <h3>Office Quest </h3>
            <p>
              The goal of this project was to create a web responsive app, which would be fun and simple to use while increasing learning curve and eliminating frustration which comes with starting new job.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a part of my studies I was tasked to create a scavenger hunt like app. Before diving into this project I have spend some time identifying proper need and where this can be applied.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually I have chosen to focus on on boarding process in large and enterprise companies, which is currently not personal, boring and falling behind expectations of newbies.

            <h3>Rapid Testing Framework</h3>
            <p>
              In this project I was tasked to create a research and test framework for large enterprise company to validate assumption and test new features and POCs (Proof of Concept) within 24/48hours turnaround.
            </p>
            <p>
              While most of large companies still follow waterfall methodology, in this case we have decided to gather ideas from all across business and users. These were put through RTS allowing to quickly triage ideas based on feasibility,
              real-time user feedback and impact on various KPIs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In weekly runs decisions are made on which ideas will be eliminated, ”parked” for the moment and which will be pushed to further agile production cycle.
